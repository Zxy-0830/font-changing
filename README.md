# Click Here Web Application

**Click Here** is a simple web application designed to help IT students understand basic DOM manipulation and interactivity using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this project, you can dynamically 
adjust the style of a heading by toggling text case, switching bold on/off, increasing or decreasing font size, changing font families, and resetting the styles to default.

## Project Overview

This project was built to showcase a concept that is both intriguing and beneficial for IT students who are learning front-end development. The application provides a hands-on example of:
- Changing text case (uppercase/lowercase)
- Toggling bold styling
- Adjusting font size with limits
- Switching between different font families
- Resetting to default styles

All interactions are handled by JavaScript, and the application’s layout is styled using CSS.

## Features

- **Case Toggle:**  
  Toggle the heading text between uppercase and lowercase. The button text updates to indicate the next action.

- **Bold Toggle:**  
  Switch the font weight between normal and bold, with the button label reflecting the current state.

- **Font Size Adjustment:**  
  Increase or decrease the heading's font size by 5px with each click, while enforcing a minimum of 20px and a maximum of 100px. When a limit is reached, a reminder message is displayed, and the corresponding button is disabled.

- **Font Family Selection:**  
  Change the heading’s font by selecting an option from the dropdown menu.

- **Reset Functionality:**  
  Reset all modifications (text case, font weight, font size, and font family) back to the default values.
